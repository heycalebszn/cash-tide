1. I need to make the triangle animation smooth and not just pop
2. And it should only start when i scroll up and at least reach the paragraph
3. The middle texts the triangle covers should be orange orange so it can be visible

# Jeton card section
1. More balls
2. The balls should fill the section bottom after they have fallen from the top with only few(2-3) falling on the form "from" card just like the current implementation.
